        <p class="hero1">Hi!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="heroBody">I'm Jerry, a UX Designer who enjoys board games and giant robots. I love bringing others joy by creating great Web and mobile experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="heroFine">(P.S. I know what my last name looks like, but it's pronounced "wawng", like the "aw" in "awesome." Thanks for taking note!)</p>

          <img> <!-- an image that depicts my first skill -->
          <h3>Figma</h3>
          <p>I use Figma to develop low- and high-fidelity prototypes, on Desktop, Mobile, and Wearables.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img> <!-- an image that depicts my second skill -->
          <h3>User Interviewing</h3>
          <p>I empathize emotionally with the user. I help them feel heard and understood by repeating what they said using my own words. I gently assure them there are no wrong answers.

        <div>
          <img> <!-- an image that depicts my third skill -->
          <h3>Presentation</h3>
          <p>When presenting work, I excel at using a conversational style that helps the audience feel personally engaged with. I make sure that the farther person in the room can hear me, and I assume that not everyone in the audience will fully understand UX/UI/Developer vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Pets form an intimate bond with their owners. We gave users a way to document and commemorate this deeply personal relationship.

            <p>We reorganized and refreshed Tony’s Place’s website to more accurately show users how bright and welcoming they truly are. We also gave them a way to help users who could not physically reach their building.
